# [RPGit](http://rp-git.com)

This project is a small "Role Playing Git", based on a Github's events analyze. For each events from a user (issue, pull request, push), your experience will increase (the number of experience points won depends on the repository popularity).

Every day, a global and a daily ranking are updated, suspects accounts (more than 250 pushes in a day), are removed. You can either, looking for a given user profile and check its languages stats (and repository stats). 

It's an open source project, built with a lot of open source tools such as :

* [Go programming language](http://golang.org/)
* [Revel framework (backend)](http://revel.github.io/)
* [Semantic UI framework (frontend)](http://semantic-ui.com/)
* [MongoDB as a database](http://www.mongodb.org/)
* [mgo as MongoDB connector](https://labix.org/mgo)
* [Handlerbars JS](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
